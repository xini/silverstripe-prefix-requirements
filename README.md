# Silverstripe Prefix Requirements

## Overview

Adds a file hash prefix to all requirements. Replaces the default ?{mtime} suffix to make the requirements fully 
cacheable.

Whenever a CSS or Javascript file is changed, a new prefixed version of the file is generated. This makes the files 
fully cacheable because whenever a change is made a file with a new URL is included in the HTML.

It is recommended to minify CSS files using Grunt or Gulp (or any other technique you might want to use). 

## Requirements

* Silverstripe CMS 6.x

## Installation

1. composer require innoweb/silverstripe-prefix-requirements
2. run dev/build

## Usage

The prefixed files are generated and stored in the default `CombinedFilesFolder` of the `Requirements_Backend` class. 
You can use the following entry in your `config.yml` to specify where the generated files are stored:

```yaml
SilverStripe\View\Requirements_Backend:
  default_combined_files_folder: '_your_folder'
``` 

Default is `ASSETS_DIR . '/_combinedfiles'`.

This module doesn't handle css and js in the CMS. 

Because the files are moved to the configured `CombinedFilesFolder`, please make sure you only use paths 
relative to the website root for includes in your css and js files. 
E.g. `/_resources/themes/yourtheme/images/icon.png`, not `../images/icon.png`.

You can exclude certain requirements from being re-written using config:

```yaml
Innoweb\PrefixRequirements\Control\PrefixResourceURLGenerator:
  excluded_resources:
    - 'vendor/lekoala/silverstripe-debugbar/**/*'
    - 'vendor/jonom/silverstripe-betternavigator/**/*'
```

You can also change the format that is used for the hash and switch it to postfix instead of prefix:

```yaml
Innoweb\PrefixRequirements\Control\PrefixResourceURLGenerator:
  nonce_style: [mtime|sha1|md5]
  use_postfix: true
```
